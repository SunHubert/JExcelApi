* Incorporated the patch from Olivier for improved reading of headers and footers
* Added the facility to make cells read only by using the formula ="". Had to change the setDataValidationRange function to accept empty strings
* Fixed a bug whereby adding an image messed up data validation - had to explicitly add in a combo box drawing when data validation is present
* Added null check for DVParser in addCell method in RowRecord
* Improved the handling for skipping unsupported object types: read the unprocessed records and added them to the drawing data so that it prevented the system from crashing
